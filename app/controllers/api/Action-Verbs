1) I consider to know cell phones inside and out, i have spent a great time of my life either fixing or modifying cell phones to do some other function, or even make the phone better, some with risks (jailbreaking iphones). I could teach somebody how to comfortably manuver through the phone with ease, and as well as laptops. 

2) The most access i have of groups so far are simply family, friends and co-workers. I am unfortunately embarking on the world of code alone, besides having my class in actualize, nobody i know shares the same interest of technology, so tht is something i am working on to find a group that does!
